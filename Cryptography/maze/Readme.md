# Maze 

### Description
150 points

The truth lies not in victory, but in the echoes left behind.


### Solution
So base on that description we search project file and me see an file without extension. So we open that and we find the function that gave the flag.

```javascript   
// maze/srz/maze

function secret() {
  const flg = CSC25{s1mple_js_ObfusCation};
}
```
